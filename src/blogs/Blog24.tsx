                        <p className="text-justify">Personal injury law, also known as tort law, provides legal remedies to individuals
                                who have been harmed by the wrongful actions of others. The purpose is to compensate victims for their
                                losses and hold the responsible parties accountable. Personal injury cases typically arise when someone acts
                                negligently, recklessly, or intentionally, causing harm to another person.</p>
                        <p className="text-justify">Examples of personal injury cases include:</p>

                        <p className="text-justify">Before pursuing a personal injury claim, it&rsquo;s essential to understand the
                                foundational concepts that govern these cases.</p>
                        <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-5">Negligence</h3>
                        <p className="text-justify">Negligence is the cornerstone of most personal injury claims. To succeed in your
                                case, you must prove the following elements:</p>
                        <ul className="flex flex-col list-outside list-decimal gap-5 ml-10 font-semibold">
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Duty of Care: <span className="font-normal">The defendant owed you a duty
                                        to act reasonably and avoid causing harm.</span></li>
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Breach of Duty: <span className="font-normal">The defendant failed to meet
                                        this duty through negligent or reckless actions.</span></li>
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Causation: <span className="font-normal">The breach directly caused your
                                        injury.</span></li>
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Damages: <span className="font-normal">You suffered measurable losses as a
                                        result.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-5">Statute of Limitations</h3>
                        <p className="text-justify">Every state has a time limit for filing personal injury claims, known as the statute
                                of limitations. Depending on your location and the type of case, this period can range from one to six
                                years. Missing this deadline could bar you from pursuing compensation, so it&rsquo;s crucial to act
                                promptly.</p>
                        <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl mt-5">Comparative Negligence</h3>
                        <p className="text-justify">In some cases, you may share responsibility for your injury. States follow different
                                rules for handling this situation:</p>
                        <ul className="flex flex-col list-outside list-decimal gap-5 ml-10 font-semibold">
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Pure Comparative Negligence: <span className="font-normal">You can recover
                                        damages even if you were mostly at fault, but your compensation is reduced by your percentage of
                                        fault.</span></li>
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Modified Comparative Negligence: <span className="font-normal">You can
                                        recover damages only if you were less than 50% (or 51% in some states) at fault.</span></li>
                                <li className="text-justify font-semibold">Contributory Negligence: <span className="font-normal">In a few states,
                                        any fault on your part bars you from recovering damages.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p className="text-justify">Insurance companies play a central role in personal injury claims, as they often
